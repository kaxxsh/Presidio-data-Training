## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and set up your environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

## Git Integration

### Setting Up Git

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

3. **Commit your changes**:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add a descriptive message about your changes"
    ```

4. **Push your branch** to the repository:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```

5. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub to merge your changes into the `main` branch.

### Git Workflow

- **Main branch**: Stable production-ready code.
- **Develop branch**: Latest changes that are in active development.
- **Feature branches**: New features or bug fixes. Always branch off from `develop`.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment. The pipeline is configured using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), but other services like [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), or [GitLab CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/continuous-integration/) can be used as well.

### Continuous Integration

On every push to the repository, the CI pipeline is triggered to:

1. **Run Tests**: Unit tests are executed to ensure code quality.
2. **Lint Code**: Code is linted to maintain coding standards.
3. **Build**: The project is built to verify that it compiles or works as expected.

### Continuous Deployment

After successful testing and building, the code is automatically deployed to the specified environment.

### Example Workflow Configuration

Hereâ€™s an example of a GitHub Actions workflow configuration:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test

    - name: Build
      run: npm run build

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Deploy to Production
      run: |
        echo "Deploying to production..."
        # Add your deployment script or commands here
```

## Deployment Environments

- **Development**: Used for testing and development.
- **Staging**: Pre-production environment for final testing.
- **Production**: Live environment where the application is accessible to users.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to configure the project for different environments. Set these variables in your CI/CD settings or use a `.env` file for local development.

```plaintext
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=username
DB_PASS=password
API_KEY=your-api-key
```
